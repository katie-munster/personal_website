At Bren, I am specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I am interested in marine conservation and fisheries management and am eager to use my data analysis skills to step enhance natural-resource management.\n              In my free time, I enjoy spending time by the ocean and doing most water activities. Fishing and stand-up paddle boarding are my favorites! I have grown up fishing in Lake Tahoe, but my favorite place I have fished was off the coast of Maui.\n            \n            \n              My experience is in mathematics, data privacy, and data analysis.

During my undergraduate career, I completed a thesis project, for which I used programming and data analysis skills to study the effect of citizen science applications on the marine plastic pollution crisis. This project was inspired by my semester abroad in college, where I was fortunate to learn from marine scientists in Spain and Morocco, as well as my previous experiences with a local marine research and education foundation.
