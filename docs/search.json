During my undergraduate career, I completed a thesis project, for which I used programming and data analysis skills to study the effect of citizen science applications on the marine plastic pollution crisis. This project was inspired by my semester abroad in college, where I was fortunate to learn from marine scientists in Spain and Morocco, as well as my previous experiences with a local marine research and education foundation.
