#### Professional experience
My experience is primarily in mathematics, data analysis, and data privacy. I previously worked as a Technology Consultant at Ernst & Young, and I recently began my studies at the Bren School to pursue my passions for the environment and solving environmental problems. At Bren, I am specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I am interested in marine conservation and fisheries management and am eager to use my data analysis skills to enhance natural resource management.

#### Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy water activities and spending time by the ocean. Fishing and stand-up paddle boarding are my favorites! I have grown up fishing for rainbow trout and kokanee salmon in Lake Tahoe, but my favorite fishing spot is off the coast of Maui, where I caught a wahoo!
