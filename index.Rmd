I am a Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I graduated summa cum laude from Syracuse University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Information Management and Technology. During my undergraduate career, I completed a thesis project, for which I used programming and data analysis skills to study the effect of citizen science applications on the marine plastic pollution crisis. This project was inspired by my semester abroad in college, where I was fortunate to learn from marine scientists in Spain and Morocco, as well as my previous experiences with a local marine research and education foundation. Upon college graduation, I worked as a Technology Consultant in the Cybersecurity practice at Ernst & Young, LLP. Now at the Bren School, I am focusing on solving environmental problems and hoping to step into the natural resource management space.
